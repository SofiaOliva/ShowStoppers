Greetings, dear Wizard. 
I am the god of spring, of rebirth, and life anew.
I offer seeds of life to you and your allies [RIGHT-CLICK anywhere on the map].
Enter their holy aura to be instantly healed. Linger within them to regenerate further.
Take caution: My blessing applies not just to your and your allies, but to the constructs of ice as well.
Continue to honor my blessing, or you and your allies may meet an untimely demise.
