Greetings, mortal. 
I am the god of summer, of its heat, its bite, its ferocity.
The fire inside you glows brightly, I can tell. 
The God of Winter has stopped the realm's seasonal cycle, cursing us with everlasting frost.
Enter the frigid caverns below and seek them out.
Channel my blessing [with LEFT-CLICK] to cast a fireball forward.
If you allow your mana to overflow, I will take it as a sign of disrespect and smite one of your allies.
Use my blessing, and do not stop.
